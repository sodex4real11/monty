Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Stacks and Queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science to store and organize data.

A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where the last plate you put on top of the stack is the first one you will remove when you need one. The basic operations of a stack are:

Push: adds an element to the top of the stack. Pop: removes the top element from the stack. Peek: returns the top element of the stack without removing it. A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line of people waiting to get into a store where the first person who arrived is the first one to enter the store. The basic operations of a queue are:

Enqueue: adds an element to the back of the queue. Dequeue: removes the front element from the queue. Peek: returns the front element of the queue without removing it. Both stacks and queues have their own specific uses in programming. Stacks are often used for tasks such as maintaining the order of function calls, implementing undo/redo functionality, and checking for balanced parentheses in expressions. Queues are often used for tasks such as scheduling tasks in an operating system, handling requests in a web server, and implementing a breadth-first search algorithm in graph theory.
